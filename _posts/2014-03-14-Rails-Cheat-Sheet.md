# Rails Cheet Sheet
本文旨在记录常用的rails相关的命令

### Startup Projects
```bash
# Initialize a proejct
rails new demo
cd demo
rake about          # try to see if everything is OK
rails server        # start web server
rails destroy  model Oops     # opposite of generate
```

### Rails Generate  
```bash
rails generate controller Say hello goodbye   
rails g scaffold Product title:string  # generate module/action/view for Product, upper case seems not of usage
rails g migration add_quantity_to_line_items quantity:integer  # name of the migration will help rails to guess what's your meanning
rails g model payment_type name:string # generate model
```

### Debug
```bash
rails console
rails dbconsole
rails runner script/load_orders.rb
```

``` ruby
prd = Product.new
prd.save # => false
prd.errors.full_messages # => view error message
```

### Linux shell related
```bash
mysqld --verbose --help # lookup mysql configuration
sqlite3 -line db/development.md

```

### Rake - Ruby Make
```bash
rake -T doc # view document related task
rake --describe task # get detail description of a task
rake --tasks         # list available task for this project
rake db:create       # create the database by database.yml
rake db:migrate      # make schema change
rake db:rollback     # revert schema change
rake db:seed         # load data defined in db/seeds.rb
rake db:migrate:status # track status of migrate
rake assets:clean      # remove compiled assets
rake assets:precompile # compile all assets
rake doc:app           # generates documentation
```

### Action Model

#### Validation
```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :terms, acceptance: true
  validates :password, confirmation: true
  validates :username, exclusion: { in: %w(admin superuser) }
  validates :email, format: { with: /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i, on: :create }
  validates :age, inclusion: { in: 0..9 }
  validates :first_name, length: { maximum: 30, message: 'must be less than 30' }
  validates :age, numericality: true
  validates :username, presence: true
  validates :username, uniqueness: true
end
```

#### Create Records
TBD:

#### Find Records/Where Clauses
TBD:

#### Serialized Object to Database
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
serialize :preferences
end

user = User.create(preferences: { "background" => "black", "display" => large })
User.find(user.id).preferences # => { "background" => "black", "display" => large }
```

#### Attribute Query Method
```ruby
user = User.new(name: "David")
user.name? # => true

anonymous = User.new(name: "")
anonymous.name? # => false
```

#### Apply Migration
Rails defines a [TableDefinition][1] class to describe the schema. It could be init like below: (p.64)

```ruby
create_table :product do |t|
  t.text :title, limit: 50,
  t.decimal :price, precision:8, scale:2
end
```
[1]: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/TableDefinition.html#method-i-column "Link to Definition"

#### Add Test Data
Make full use of seeds.rb to add test data. Notice `ActiveRecord::Base#Create` and `ActiveRecord::Base#Create!`  are differenct. The second one will raise an exception if the record is invalid. (p. 69)


### Action View

### Basic Helper Functions
```html
<%= link_to "Goodbye", say_goodbye_path %>!
<%= link_to "Destroy', product, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>
<tr class = "<%= cycle('list_line_odd', 'list_line_even') %>" >
```

#### Using link_to method in program
Need more knowledge on url routine (p7x)

#### Modify Unit Test
Not known about `products(:one)` (p. 81)

#### Resize image with image_tag
we could pass size as option `size: '30x30'`

#### assert_select usage for controller auto testing

#### Cache in ruby
Rails 4 supports key based cache which could be referenced [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html)   (p.104)
We have following steps to enable cache in rails
1. set enable in config
2. change view (*.erb) for fragments that needs to cache
3. set storage method for cache

#### Dependency for controller code in rails
The following code could run in rails, so what is in the running environment. How could the ActiveSupport, ActiveRecord and Cart be found? We could also pay attention to the private mark. This would prevent rails to treat the `set_cart` method as controller method.

Answers: 
1. modules in `app/controllers/concern/` could be accessed in all controllers

```ruby
module CurrentCart
extend ActiveSupport::Concern
private
  def set_cart
    @cart = Cart.find(session[:cart_id])
    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    @cart = Cart.create
    session[:cart_id] = @cart
  end
end
```

#### How to add connection table in rails
Table LineItem is connection table for product and cart.

```bash
rails generate scaffold LineItem product:references cart:belongs_to
```

```ruby
class LineItem < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :product
  belongs_to :cart
end
```

To add method for reverse finding from Cart we should modify Cart's model
```ruby
class Cart < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :line_items, dependent: :destroy
end
```

#### How to choose Get/Post methods
`links_to` method will generate `Http Get` method. `button_to` will generate `POST` method.

#### Parameters of method in ActionPack
There are always kind of function has the following signature `(name = nil, options = nil, html_options = nil, &block)`. I cann't see there is a need for such parameters.

#### Passing objects between controllers
`params` is used to pass values between controllers.

#### Error when using session
`cookieOverflow` exception throws when add item to cart. By searching the web, it is because session data is too large to store by cookie.  Change it to use database to store the value. A new gem `activerecord-session_store` is introduced.

Q: I still don't know there is the document for 'cookieOverflow'. Not in the api doc.
`++` operator is not support in Ruby
`activerecord#destroy` will trigger callback, however `activerecord#delete` won't.

#### Flash in rails
Flash is hash-like object, which could pass information to following requests.

#### Test in Rails
Assertions.
assert_equal, assert_not_equal

#### Ruby js
ruby js may generate code with not exists node, in this time, it will be ignored.

#### Run ruby scripts under rails
```ruby
Order.transaction do
  (1..100) do |i|
    Order.create (...) 
  end
end
```

```bash
rails runner script/load_orders.rb
```

#### Rails send email

```bash
rails generate mailer Notifier order_received order_shipped
# create app/mailers/notifier.rb
# create ap/views/notifier/order_received.text.erb
# create ap/views/notifier/order_shipped.text.erb
# create test/functional/notifier_test.rb
```

usage
```ruby
Notifer.order_received(@order).deliver
```

#### Rails integration test

```bash
rails g integration_test user_stories
# create test/integration/user_stories_test.rb
```

#### Deploy ruby program on environment
apache used as front-server to process http request, and passenger will dispatch ruby reqest to rails processes.

#### CRUD With ActiveRecord

```ruby
name = params[:name]
pos = Order.where(["name = ? and pay_type = 'po'", name])

name = params[:name]
pay_type = params[:pay_type]
pos = Order.where("name = :name and pay_type = :pay_type",
pay_type: pay_type, name: name)

pos = Order.where("name = :name and pay_type = :pay_type",
params[:order])

pos = Order.where(params[:order])

pos = Order.where(name: params[:name],
pay_type: params[:pay_type])

# Doesn't work
User.where("name like '?%'", params[:name])

# Works
User.where("name like ?", params[:name]+"%")

```

#### Subsetting the Records found
```ruby
# The view wants to display orders grouped into pages,
# where each page shows page_size orders at a time.
# This method returns the orders on page page_num (starting
# at zero).
def Order.find_on_page(page_num, page_size)
  order(:id).limit(page_size).offset(page_num*page_size)
end

orders = Order.where(name: 'Dave').
order("pay_type, shipped_at DESC").
limit(10)
```

#### Lock of Active Record
```ruby
Account.transaction do
  ac = Account.where(id: id).lock("LOCK IN SHARE MODE").first
  ac.balance -= amount if ac.balance > amount
  ac.save
end
```

 #### Statics of Result
```ruby
average = Order.average(:amount) # average amount of orders
max = Order.maximum(:amount)
min = Order.minimum(:amount)
total = Order.sum(:amount)
number = Order.count
```

#### Scopes : to reuse simple data.
```ruby
class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :last_n_days, lambda { |days| where('updated < ?' , days) }
  scope :checks, -> { where(pay_type: :check) }
end

orders = Order.last_n_days(7)
orders = Order.checks.last_n_days(7)
```

#### Update on ActiveRecord
```ruby
# fetch and update record, id is used as first parameter
order = Order.update(12, name: "Barney", email: "barney@bedrock.com")
# where clause is the second parameter
# return result depends on database adapter
result = Product.update_all("price = 1.1*price", "title like '%Java%'")
```

#### Delete Rows
```ruby
# delete method bypass the validation and ActiveRecord callback
Order.delete(123)
User.delete([2,3,4,5])

# when no condition is given, all rows are deleted.
Product.delete_all(["price > ?", @expensive_price])
```

#### Active Record Callback
```ruby
class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  before_validation :normalize_credit_card_number
  after_create do |order|
     logger.info "Order #{order.id} created"
  end
  protected
  def normalize_credit_card_number

   # Notice we have to use self. since this is class method???/
    self.cc_number.gsub!(/[-\s]/, '')
  end
end
```

#### Action Pack

Action Dispatch helps to find controller and method for processing request. There are two ways to defined the routes, pre-defined and self-defined.

```ruby
Depot::Application.routes.draw do
  # pre-defined, 
  # This assumes there is a controller named 'ProductController' and several methods with given names
  resources :products
  resources :comments, except: [:update, :destroy]  # update, destroy is not in need.
  # sef-defined
  resources :products do
    get :who_bought, on: :member  # :collection ~
  end
end
```

We could use `rake routes` to review the generated routes.
Notes: 'GET    /products(.:format) products#index'  the `/products(.:format)` stands for '/product/1.html` or '/product/1.xml'

There are 7 methods that rails generate for us. `index`,`create`,`new`,`show`,`destroy`,`edit`,`update`

Diff: `create` and `new`, `create` receives a bunch of attributes from POST request and create a new source and save it. `new` method is only create a empty resource used to gather inputs from client, resource is not saved. It is like `initialized` method in Base Module

`edit` and `update`, `edit` returns the content of a resource identified by `params[:id]`, `update` will update the resource by `params[:id]` with data associated with request.

We could fire a request on client by ruby methods

```html
<% link_to 'Show', product %>
# link_to generate a HTTP GET by default, so need to specify using DELETE instead.
<% link_to 'Destroy', product, method: :delete %>
```

Rails uses one controller method to handle all types of output(xml/json/html). This may increase difficulty for error handling.

#### Process request in controller
TBD

#### Q&A

* Where to find the document for phantom method, since they are created dynamically? e.g. _find*_
* Rails method has return type, however it is hard to find them.
* Help function `content_tag` is no use in my sample
* Duplicate item is added when click image.
* How to create class method like before_validate, it could use a class instance as parameter, which method it knows to call.
* It is not safe to store primary key in the url. The default route of rails needs to changed? p309
* In RESTful design, the server only works on CRUD of resources. Is there any concern about the validation?? p310
* Nested routes will provide all resource information on the full path? p318
* Error handling when user specify illegal URI. `http://192.168.33.15:3000/products/1/who_bought.sfas` 
* What is a permanent/temporary redirect? what's the differences?
* How we could build a custom program avoid using ActionPack
* How to deploy with passenger? There is no content under public directory. p237.
